Day 1: A Spiritual Start

The first day of our induction at GNDEC began with a visit to the Gurdwara Sahib, where we offered prayers and received blessings for our future journey. The peaceful environment and kirtan set a positive tone for the day.

After a light breakfast, we attended a welcome session in the auditorium. Our Principal, HODs, and Trustees addressed us. Notable speakers included Dr. Sahajpal Singh, Dr. Harpit Kaur, and our respected Trustees. They shared words of encouragement and guidance for our upcoming years at GNDEC.

It was a warm and inspiring start to our college life.
